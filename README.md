**Author:** *Shtufff*  
**Date:** 17 December 2025

This repository contains configuration `.json` files for the video game "Arma Reforger".

## What one do I need?

If you want to run a website that has server stats like player count and the likes, use the `A2S` File. 

If this is not something you want and you want to use mods, use `config.json`.

If you want no mods or admins use `blank.json`.

Note that when using these files they must be renamed to `config.json` when adding it to your server, or else it wont work!

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
