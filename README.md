# Arma Reforger Server Configuration Files

**Author:** *Shtufff*  
**Date:** 17 December 2025

This repository contains configuration `.json` files for the video game "Arma Reforger".

## What one do I need?

If you want to run a website that has server stats like player count and the likes, use the `A2S` File. If this is not something you want, use the regular `config.json`.

Note that when using the `A2SPublic_config.json` it must be renamed to `config.json` when adding it to your server, or else it wont work!

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
